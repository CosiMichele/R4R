## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
I have used git and github a lot. I have used MacOS or Linux only, so to know about how shell works in windows nowadays using Windows WSL was nice. 

### Bud: 
I am using github already in my research and I encourage other people too. I have developed one [framework](https://github.com/pal0064/sonic) as well  to start a data sciecne project.

### Thorn: 
- I think to make it simple for windows users, we can use virtualbox with ubuntu or any other linux distribution. I saw people struggling with WSL. 
- It's good to follow git conventions for e.g. branch names, commit msgs. This could be part of curriculum as well. The framework I mentioned that I deveoped uses commitlint.js that checks commit msg conventions. Similarly we can enforce branch name conventions as well. 

## Additional thought
Not anything like that as of now.
