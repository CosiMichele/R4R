# R4R
Roots for Resilience

This repository contains the *journal*, a weekly log where students write their thoughts on content in Foundational Open Science Skills (FOSS).

After each FOSS session, students will write their thoughts on the session (using Rose, Bud, Thorn) using the markdown template (e.g., *journal_12sept2023.md*). We will use this information to drive some discussion on Tuesday sessions. 

## Instructions

1. Students in R4R will clone this repo (the branch with their name) to their local machine.  Please push your changes to your branch by the following Monday.
