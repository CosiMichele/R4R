Student in R4R will clone this repo (the branch with their name) to their local machine. After each FOSS session, students will write their thoughts on the session (using Rose, Bud, Thorn) using the markdown template. Please push your changes to your branch by the following Monday. We will use this information to drive some discussion on Tuesday sessions.
